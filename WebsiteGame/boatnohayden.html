    <h1>Speeding Off on the Bay</h1>
    
    
    <p class="Description">
You decide to go on separate boats, and Hayden picks a nice big yacht, while you pick the smaller speed boat. You start to make your way onto the bay, untouchable to the zombies, but you see Haydenâ€™s boat get a hoard of zombies on board. You hear gunshots, and the boat begins to move. With no time to waste, you begin to speed toward Alcatraz, and radio the CDC as you approach the island. You get an OK from an operator, and travel towards safety, with Hayden behind in the big yacht.
